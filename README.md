**Lung Cancer Detection Using Transfer Learning**

Project Overview:
This project implements a deep learning model for detecting lung cancer from histopathological images using transfer learning. Leveraging the power of TensorFlow and Keras with a pre-trained InceptionV3 model, the project aims to classify images into different categories indicating the presence or absence of lung cancer.

Features:
1. Data Preprocessing: Includes image resizing and normalization for model compatibility.
2. Transfer Learning: Utilizes the InceptionV3 model with pre-trained weights for feature extraction.
3. Model Customization: Adds custom dense layers to the pre-trained model for specific task training.
4. Flask Web Application: Provides an interactive web interface for uploading images and receiving predictions.
   
Installation:
To run this project, you need to install the required dependencies. Clone this repository and install the dependencies using the following commands:

- git clone <https://github.com/arnavc16/Lung_Cancer_Detection>
- cd <Lung_Cancer_Detection>
- pip install -r requirements.txt

Usage:
To start the Flask web application, run:

python app.py

1. Navigate to http://127.0.0.1:5000/ in your web browser.
2. Upload a lung histopathological image and receive the model's prediction.

Model Training:
Details about the model training process are as follows:

1. Dataset: Describe the dataset used, including source and characteristics.
2. Training Process: Explain the training process, including any specific steps taken for optimization.
3. Evaluation Metrics: Discuss the metrics used to evaluate the model's performance.
   
Flask Web Application:
1. Upload Feature: Users can upload histopathological images.
2. Prediction: The model predicts and displays whether the image indicates lung cancer.
3. Result Display: The application shows the prediction result along with the uploaded image.

Project Structure:

1. lung_cancer_model.py: Contains the model and prediction logic.
2. app.py: Flask application for interacting with the model.
3. templates/: HTML templates for the web interface.
4. static/: Contains static files like CSS and uploaded images.
